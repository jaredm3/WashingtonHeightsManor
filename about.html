            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <h5>Supporting Independence and Community Living</h5>

            <p>Washington Heights Manor I and II were established in 2008 and 2017, respectively. We are a human services agency guided by faith-based principles.  The agency partners with adult residents, their families and the community to provide a comprehensive array of services to promote an adult’s highest potential for independent living.</p>

            <p>Our programming represents collaboration on the part of numerous county agencies, community outreach services, religious organizations and family participation.  Each partner plays an important role in the residents’ care.   The above groups all require mental and emotional support and encouragement in order to provide the highest quality of daily living.  As a facility, we will help them maintain and strengthen their maximum potential of independent living through personal care, socialization, enhancing communication skills and involvement in the community.</p>

            <p>Above all, family support of our residents is the primary factor in the progress of the resident.  Residents and their extended family will be encouraged to spend time on and off site to keep and/or build a foundation of purpose so that they understand they are not alone in life’s challenges.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in our facilities, we are happy to discuss options with you and welcome you to tour our locations.</p>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

            <p>The Staff of Washington Heights Manor</p>
